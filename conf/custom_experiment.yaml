# Custom experiment configuration
# Example of a customized configuration for specific experiments

# Inherit from base config
defaults:
  - config
  - _self_

# Override settings
mode: evaluate
random_seed: 123  # Different seed for reproducibility

# Custom algorithm settings with more iterations and population
algorithm:

  max_iterations: 500
  crossover_prob: 0.9
  mutation_prob: 0.1
  gns_levels: 3
  max_time: 1800  # 30 minutes

# Dataset focus on large instances
dataset:
  name: benchmark
  path: data
  size_filter: large  # Only large instances
  pattern_filter: mixed  # Only mixed pattern
  complexity_range: [300, 1000]  # Higher complexity
  max_instances: 20  # Fewer instances due to longer runtime

# Custom visualization settings
